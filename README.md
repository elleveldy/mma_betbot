# mma_betbot

Uses betmma.tips to get an estimate of what handicappers with sufficiently positive track record deem to be acceptable odds for a fighter to win a specific match. If the "acceptable odds" off both sides of the match results in a hypothetical arbitrage (betting on both sides with those odds would result in guaranteed profit), store the match as a potential value match. If we get the acceptable odds at our bookie (pinnacle), make the bet.
